# DarcyBot
A fun chatBot for my Discord at work. Used to automate email replys, reference older discussions, and chat about good times.

### `/chat`
Chat with DarcyBot. DarcyBot has short term memory, and uses semantic search to reference older memories within the Discord.

### `/lore`
Manually add lore to the bot's long term memory. Lore entry should be reasonably detailed.

### `/help`
See available commands.
